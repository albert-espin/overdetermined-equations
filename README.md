# Numerical Algorithms for solving Overdetermined Equation Systems

The programs of this repository can solve overdetermined linear equations systems, namely some particular cases and techniques are explorer:
- Triangular equation systems ("triangular_systems.c").
- LDLt decomposition method ("LDLt_decomposition.c").
- Normal equation systems ("normal_equations.c").
